\frametitle{Floats}
Tables and figures in \LaTeX{} are generally enclosed in environments called \keyw{floats}. \\[\baselineskip] \pause
\LaTeX{} automatically recognizes tables and figures, but it is also possible to define other floats. \\ \pause
\begin{block}{Definition: Floats}
    \emph{Floats} are blocks of content that ``float" around the page. They act as containers for objects in a document that should not be split up or broken over a page.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Floats}
Floats are not part of the normal stream of text --- \LaTeX{} decides where to place them automatically using internal algorithms. \\[\baselineskip] \pause
They can be moved around by changing where they are defined in the source code or by adjusting parameters that control automatic floating. \\[\baselineskip] \pause
It is considered good practice not to change float positioning during drafting --- let \LaTeX{} position the floats first and make manual adjustments at the end of the drafting process.
